## Problem to solve

It would be great to have a Try section where people can write relational algebra
on their own data.

1. On left, They would be able to upload CSV/json files and give them a name.
   Suppliers and parts exemplar would be loaded by default.
2. On right/up a quite large codemirror instance would allow writing Typescript
   code with a Bmg.js expression.
3. On right/bottom, one would see the result in JSON/CSV

Possible with something as simple as Basecamp's stimulus or should we use Vue3 ?
