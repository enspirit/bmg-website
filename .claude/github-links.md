## Problem to solve

We currently have only one link to the Ruby library. We should have links to

- Bmg Ruby (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg)
- Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js)
- The website implementation (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg-website)

How can we improve the website (and README) to have something clearer ?
What link do we keep under the icon in header ?
