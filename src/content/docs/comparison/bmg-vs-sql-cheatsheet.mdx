This pages summarizes usual SQL queries and their equivalent in Bmg. Please carefully read the notes below each example, as subtle semantics differences exist between Bmg and SQL regarding: duplicate tuples, duplicate attribute names, tuple ordering and null.

## SELECT

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT sid, name FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .project([:sid, :name])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### DISTINCT

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT city FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .project([:city])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Unlike SQL, Bmg never returns duplicates, hence the absence of a `.distinct` operator. Bmg's SQL compiler will automatically introduce `DISTINCT` if needed to filter duplicates.

### Renaming...

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    sid AS supplier_id
  FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .rename(:sid => :supplier_id)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    id AS supplier_id,
    name AS supplier_name,
    city AS supplier_city,
    status AS supplier_status
  FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .prefix(:supplier_)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    id AS id_supplier,
    name AS name_supplier,
    city AS city_supplier,
    status AS status_supplier
  FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .suffix(:_supplier)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Unlike SQL, Bmg does not support multiple attributes having the same name (aka duplicate attributes). Bmg's `.prefix` and `.suffix` have no equivalent in SQL: you'll have to do the job manually, as in the example above.

### All but an attribute...

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    sid,
    name,
    city
  FROM suppliers
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .allbut([:status])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

SQL does not support an `ALLBUT` keyword. You'll have to select all attributes but those that you want to throw away, as in the example above.

## WHERE

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers
  WHERE city = 'London'
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .restrict(city: 'London')
  ```
  or
  ```ruby
  p = Predicate.eq(:city, 'London')
  suppliers
    .restrict(p)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers
  WHERE city <> 'London'
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .exclude(city: 'London')
  ```
  or
  ```ruby
  p = Predicate.neq(:city, 'London')
  suppliers
    .restrict(p)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers
  WHERE city IN ('London', 'Paris')
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .restrict(city: ['London', 'Paris'])
  ```
  or
  ```ruby
  p = Predicate.in(:city, ['London', 'Paris'])
  suppliers
    .restrict(p)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Please refer to [Predicate's documentation](https://github.com/enspirit/predicate) or [Bmg's README](https://github.com/enspirit/bmg) for the full list of supported predicates.

### EXISTS / IN

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers s
  WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM supplies ss
    WHERE ss.sid = s.sid
  )
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .matching(supplies, [:sid])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers s
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM supplies ss
    WHERE ss.sid = s.sid
  )
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .not_matching(supplies, [:sid])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

We discourage the usage of `WHERE (NOT) IN` in SQL since its semantics in presence of `NULL` may generate subtle bugs. Bmg's `matching` and `not_matching` can be used everytime you'd be using `IN` in SQL.

## JOIN

### CROSS

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT s.*, p.*
  FROM
    suppliers s,
    parts p
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .cross_join(parts)
  ```
  or
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .join(parts, [])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Please note that Bmg does not allow duplicate attribute names. Hence, the examples above are only equivalent if `suppliers` and `parts` have no attribute in common. In practice, Bmg simply ignores attributes of the right operand that already exist on the left operand, in the join result.

In other words, the following compilation actually applies:

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .cross_join(parts)
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    s.sid,
    s.name,
    s.status,
    s.city,
    p.pid
    -- p.name, p.status and p.city are ignored
  FROM
    suppliers s,
    parts p
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### EQUI

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT s.*, ss.*
  FROM
    suppliers s
  JOIN
    supplies ss ON ss.sid = s.sid
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .join(supplies, [:sid])
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT s.*, ss.*
  FROM
    suppliers s
  JOIN
    supplies ss ON ss.supplier_id = s.id
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .join(supplies, :supplier_id => :sid)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The same remark about duplicate attribute names applies here. In presence of conflictual attributes, the following compilation applies:

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .join(parts, [:city])
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    s.sid,
    s.name,
    s.city,
    s.status,
    p.pid
    -- p.name, p.status and p.city are ignored
  FROM
    suppliers s
  JOIN
    parts p ON p.city = s.city
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### THETA

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT s.*, p.*
  FROM
    suppliers s
  JOIN
    parts p ON s.status > p.status
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .rename(:status => :s_status)
    .cross_join(parts.rename(:status => :p_status))
    .restrict(Predicate.gt(:s_status, :p_status))
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The same remark about duplicate attribute names applies here.

### LEFT

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    s.sid,
    s.name,
    s.city,
    s.status,
    COALESCE(p.pid, 'none') AS pid
  FROM
    suppliers s
  LEFT JOIN
    parts p ON s.city = p.city
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .left_join(parts, [:city], :pid => 'none')
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Bmg allows providing an optional 'default' tuple for missing ones on right operand. Not using it generates `NULL`/`nil` like SQL, which may expose subtle bugs further down in your data transformation.

## UNION

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT city FROM suppliers
  UNION
  SELECT city FROM parts
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .project([:city])
    .union(parts.project([:city]))
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## MINUS

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT city FROM suppliers
  MINUS
  SELECT city FROM parts
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .project([:city])
    .minus(parts.project([:city]))
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## GROUP BY

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    city, MAX(status)
  FROM
    suppliers s
  GROUP BY
    city
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .summarize([:city], :status => :max)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT
    city, COUNT(*) AS c
  FROM
    suppliers s
  GROUP BY
    city
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .summarize([:city], :c => Bmg::Summarizer.count)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## LIMIT / OFFSET

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers s
  ORDER BY status DESC
  LIMIT 3
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .page([[:status, :desc]], 1, :page_size => 3)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card>
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM suppliers s
  ORDER BY status DESC
  OFFSET 6 LIMIT 3
  ```
  </Card>
  <Card>
  ```ruby
  suppliers
    .page([[:status, :desc]], 3, :page_size => 3)
  ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Unlike SQL, Bmg does not support limit/offset without specifying an ordering relation (SQL's `ORDER BY`), since the result is non deterministic.
